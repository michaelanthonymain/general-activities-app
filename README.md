DBC General Activity Signup
======================

The Dev Bootcamp general activities application is a way for devbootcamp students to organize group events: catering food, planning weekend yoga, movie nights, etc.

The app was built by four Dev Bootcamp students (Jaime Schubert, Amelia Padua, Jarrod Scott, and Michael Main) in five days. It was our first attempt at using OAuth2, testing frameworks, and mailers.
